# Generic System

### Building
Clone the project, run `npm i` to install dependencies and either `npm run build` to build once or `npm run build:watch` to continously build the project.

### Installing
The project gets build to the `build` folder. You can either copy the `build` folder to your `Data/systems` folder and rename it gs, or create a symlink.

### Notes
Throughout the project there are comments in the form of `// NOTE: [...]`. These are areas I commented that I deemed especially interesting and/or confusing.
